# Parcel randomizer

Randomize maps with a parcel and plot system

Inspired by such a system from XCOM 2

# Using the program
There are 2 packages here:

SelfContainedProgram holds everything needed to run the program (Which is some 200 odd files)
Framework2_1Program requires that you have .Net framework 2.1 installed. And only has 5 files
In both instances, download the folder and run VoxelMapConverter.exe
