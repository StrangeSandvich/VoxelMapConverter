#Program configuration README

Tired of inputting the same things over and over? 
Create a json configuration with your inputs and just run that!
See the "makeLimeville" and "makeFrost" files in examples
Then run your config by inputting it's name when the program asks for a function

Or name your config "mapMakerConfig.json" for the program to run it without any further input!
