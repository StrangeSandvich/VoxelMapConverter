Todo and wishlist:

Better color approximation and reducer
Functionality to merge color indexes
Functionality to add additional ground layers for maps without open ocean. 
Avoid palette ID's that Sectors Edge uses for special things
Give underground solid color a seperate color index which can then be set in MagicaVoxel
Make sure color approximation doesn't approximate onto index 1 or 2

Convert BlockNLoad maps
Convert Minecraft Schematics
(Use Timothees stuff)
