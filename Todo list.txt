Todo and wishlist:

Functionality to show progress without spamming the console
Avoid palette ID's that Sectors Edge uses for special things
Optimizes to use the found mapheight to not use excess space

Bigger things:
Functionality to merge color indexes of existing magicavoxel maps
Convert BlockNLoad maps
Convert Minecraft Schematics
(Use Timothees stuff)


Ocean color fix solutions:
Find map height first. Ignore those blocks. 
Come in after with a palette shrink that combines all ocean colors
