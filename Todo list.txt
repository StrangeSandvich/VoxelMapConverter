Todo and wishlist:

Functionality to ignore ocean colors on palette
Functionality to add additional ground layers for maps without open ocean. 
Functionality to show progress without spamming the console
Avoid palette ID's that Sectors Edge uses for special things
Make sure color approximation doesn't approximate onto index 1

Bigger things:
Functionality to merge color indexes of existing magicavoxel maps
Convert BlockNLoad maps
Convert Minecraft Schematics
(Use Timothees stuff)
