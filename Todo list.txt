Todo and wishlist:

Don't generate high empty objects when converting flat maps. 
Better color approximation and reducer
Somehow figure out map height??
Somehow ignore ocean/ocean colors
Avoid palette ID's that Sectors Edge uses for special things
Ability to pick color of Solid AoS blocks (Currently black)
Ability to pick output file name


Convert BlockNLoad maps
Convert Minecraft Schematics
(Use Timothees stuff)
