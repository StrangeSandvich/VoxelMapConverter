Todo and wishlist:

Nicer way to display progress
Update reserved indexes after asking Verc
Make it so the reservedID shuffle works when number of colors is chosen to be less than the highest reserved id

Bigger things:
Functionality to merge color indexes of existing magicavoxel maps
Convert BlockNLoad maps
Convert Minecraft Schematics
(Use Timothees stuff)


Ocean color fix solutions:
Find map height first. Ignore those blocks. 
Come in after with a palette shrink that combines all ocean colors
